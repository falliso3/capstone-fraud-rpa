- decision (values: "not_fraud", "low_risk", "medium_risk", "high_risk")
- explanation (short description of why this transaction received this score)


Rules:
1. Only use the information provided in the input. Do not assume any external data.
2. If the input is missing or malformed, respond with:
{"error": "missing or inconsistent data", "details": "The provided transaction data is missing or invalid."}
3. Respond only with valid JSON output. Do not include extra commentary or text.
