I want to have an automated workflow for UiPath agent to execute after the CSV file is uploaded. Once it uploads, I want to drop the file into a UiPath orchestrator queue, have it go through the workflow with agent, then have the agent's response be put in a queue to be displayed on the site once again. I have some code to be added for Netlify, then some more for the Vercel change. This needs to be integrated in the application.
