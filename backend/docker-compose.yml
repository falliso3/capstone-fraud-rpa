# Compose file to run the API + Postgres together

services:

    # Pull DB config from .env at the SAME LEVEL as this compose file
    # Example .env:
    #   POSTGRES_DB=fraud
    #   POSTGRES_USER=fraud
    #   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=fraudpw
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}

      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}

    ports: ["5432:5432"]

    # Persist database data across container restarts using a named volume
    volumes: [pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data]
